# RectPulse-LPF-Simulation

This MATLAB project demonstrates the effect of a low-pass filter on a rectangular pulse signal. The script generates a rectangular pulse, applies an ideal low-pass filter using convolution with a sinc function, and plots both the input and filtered signals for comparison.

## Features
- Generates a rectangular pulse signal
- Applies an ideal low-pass filter (sinc function)
- Visualizes input and output signals in time domain

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or newer

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RectPulse-LPF-Simulation.git
