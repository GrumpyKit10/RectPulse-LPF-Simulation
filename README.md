# RectPulse-LPF-Simulation
This project demonstrates the effect of an ideal low-pass filter on a rectangular pulse signal using MATLAB. It generates a rectangular pulse, applies a sinc-based low-pass filter through convolution, and plots both the input and filtered signals in the time domain to visualize the filtering effect.
